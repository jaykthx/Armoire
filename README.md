# Message from Jay
Hi Armoire users!
Thank you for reading the README/Changelog.
This update to Armoire is one of the bigger ones I've done since recreating DxvaTableManager to make it in the first place.
It took a long time to figure out what I wanted to do to improve the program, sorry about the wait.
I learned a lot of new things along the way to try and make this update more user-friendly and give it a bit more of a "real app" feel.
I hope you enjoy it!
If you have any issues, or encounter any bugs, please do make an issue on the GitHub and let me know!

# 日本語の翻訳について
今回のアップデートは任意の日本語の翻訳も含めています。
日本語を勉強している外国人として一生懸命頑張りましたのですが、間違いや変な言葉遣いがある可能性が高いです。
自分勝手なことですが、よろしければそんな間違いが見つかることになったら、直接に教えていただきたいと思っています。
Armoireをご利用いただき、ありがとうございます。
